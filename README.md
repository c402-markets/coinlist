The structure of the repository speaks for itself. Create a pull request to add your coin, using exactly the same format as for $PING, including:

1.	All fields in the JSON file are mandatory.
2.	The thumbnail must be named after the coin's lowercase symbol, have a resolution of 512×512, and be a compressed PNG.
3.	The pool must have sufficient (locked) liquidity.
4.  The pool must be a Uniswap v3 or v4 pool.

  Even if the formatting is correct, there is no guarantee that your pull request will be accepted. Additionally, after the merge, some manual effort will be required to whitelist your coin onchain.
